This is my Final Project Submission for CSCC 32 A: Operating Systems. 

INSTRUCTIONS
After compiling and running, the program will ask for which algorithm to use.
To proceed:
Input 1 for First Come First Served (Non-preemptive)
Input 2 for Shortest Job First (Preemptive)

The program will then ask for the number of processes.
To proceed: 
Input the number of processes.

(IMPORTANT)
Then, the program will receive the specific processes, arrival time, and clock cycle/burst length of each process, respectively.
To proceed:
Please input the processes in the following format: PROCESS_NAME<space>ARRIVAL_TIME<space>CLOCK/BURST<enter> (repeat until done)
EXAMPLE:
A 0 7
B 1 3
C 4 6
